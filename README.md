# Java to C++ for Arduino

### Description
This tool is for those who wish to control their Arduinos using Java instead of the C/C++ like syntax that is used.
What this does is it takes your Java code and translates it to C++ that is used for Arduino sketches.

### Future plans
1. Library support
    - Add support for libraries.
2. More direct error parsing
    - Directly from the Java code, structure and basic errors.
3. Possibly turn this into a command line interface if I can learn how.

### How to use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/CSWesley/JavaToCppArduino`
2. Go into the "usage" directory (this will contain a jar file to execute): `cd JavaToCppArduino/src/usage`
3. Have your Java file ready and use: `java -jar JavaToCppArduino.jar <input file> <output directory>`
